## Summary:
My goal for 2023 is to read 24 books, with the stretch target of 36 books. Having only read 6 fiction books in 2022, I'd like to increase this to at least 10. 

### Run, Swim, Throw, Cheat: The Science behind drugs in sport, Chris Cooper
*Jan 2023*  
A little technical but it gave an insight into possible future methods of doping, and it seems there are several fruitful avenues to keep cheats busy. The discussion around bans for recreational drugs, and drugs that offer little genuine advantage is something I would agree with. 

### Tell me the planets: Stories of brain injuries and what it means to survive, Ben Platts-Mills
*Jan 2023*  
Stories of the authors experiences working with survivors of brain injuries. The books follows several characters and shares Platt-Mill's experiences supporting them and the many challenges that they face. 

### The Right Stuff, Tom Wolfe
*Jan 2023*  
Following the men who became the Astronauts. Why were these men willing to take on the risks involved in strapping into a rocket? What sort of person did it take?

### Rain Dogs, Adrian McKinty
*Jan 2023*  
A good detective story set in N. Ireland during the Troubles. Suitably easy reading whilst on holiday.

### Winners: And how they succeed, Alastair Campbell
*Feb 2023*  
Objective, strategy, tactics. Enjoyed his parallels between sport and other walks of life.

### Running with the Kenyans, Adharanand Finn
*Feb 2023*  
Move to Iten (Kenya), run higher mileage, get faster. I was surprised at how recent this book is, I had always assumed it was a 'classic'. 

### Freezing Order, Bill Browder
*Mar 2023*  
A sequel to Red Notice which is no less thrilling. Mr Browder has powerful enemies. I expect publishing books to gain support of Western populations is a key part of his security strategy.

### No Surrender, Hiroo Oneda
*Mar 2023*  
Deployed in 1944 and instructed to fight a guerilla war, Oneda-san spends 30yrs on a Phillipine island fighting the good fight. Remarkable endurance and willpower. 

### The Price of Time, Edward Chancellor
*Apr 2023*  
A history, and commentary, on interest and monetary policy. Low rates begot low rates, and are the villain. Interest is the pressure toward the correct allocation of capital.

### Business Adventures, John Brooks
*Apr 2023*  
Written in the 60s, the book tells twelve stories in twelve chapters. Xerox, the Ford Edsel, wall street woes, and employee IP disputes. As ever, some chapters more interesting than others. 

### All Quiet on the Western Front, Erich Remarque
*Apr 2023*  
Having watched the film it was nice to read the book. The film misses some key parts of the book like Paul's visit home, and also overly dramatises Paul's death which happens only in the final paragraph. The day Paul Baumer dies, the report of action is 'All Quiet on the Western Front'.  

### Atoms and Ashes, From Bikini Atoll to Fukushima, Serhi Plokhy
*Apr 2023*  
6 nuclear accidents, starting from hydrogen bomb testing through to Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukishima. The premise of the book is that nuclear accidents will happen and that the impact is significant. I would compare this to aircraft crashes and driving - aircraft crashes happen, when they do the severity is bad, but overall compared to driving it is much safer.

### The Tour De France, Christopher Thompson
*May 2023*  
More academic than expected but a good history of the Tour with excellent coverage of the personas, agendas, and motivations behind the Tour.

### King Rat, James Clavell 
*May 2023*  
Fiction based in Changi POW camp, detailing the struggle to survive for the British, Aussie, and American troops. The King lives a lavish lifestyle with his American ways until the currency in the POW camp is devalued at the end of the war and he loses his power.

### My Silent War, Kim Philby 
*May 2023*  
An autobiography which must be taken with a pinch of salt given Philby's recent defection to Russia at the time of writing. Quite astonishing achievement to penetrate the highest levels of British Intelligence. The colourful style from this era is always enjoyable to read. 

### Frostquake, Juliet Nicolson 
*May 2023*  
For the hobbyist meteorologist this lacked detail about the mechanism behind the extreme cold snap. It was, however, an interesting insight into the zeitgeist of the early 60s. 

### The 15:17 to Paris, Sadler et al 
*May 2023*  
Thought it would be more focused on the events of the day and the attempted terrorist attack, was more of a biography of the three Americans involved. 

### War Doctor, David Nott 
*June 2023*  
Surgery in war zones - challenging stuff! Certainly elements of a slightly troubled character but he seems to care. Particularly the chapters on Syria were quite graphically shocking.

### Ultra Marathon Man, Dean Karnazes 
*June 2023*  
It's interesting reading these books to see that the training the ultra crew do is not much more than regular runners. Seems the game is mostly in the mind.
