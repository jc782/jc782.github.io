## Summary:
My goal for 2023 is to read 24 books, with the stretch target of 36 books. Having only read 6 fiction books in 2022, I'd like to increase this to at least 10. 

### Run, Swim, Throw, Cheat: The Science behind drugs in sport, Chris Cooper
*Jan 2023*  
A little technical but it gave an insight into possible future methods of doping, and it seems there are several fruitful avenues to keep cheats busy. The discussion around bans for recreational drugs, and drugs that offer little genuine advantage is something I would agree with. 

### Tell me the planets: Stories of brain injuries and what it means to survive, Ben Platts-Mills
*Jan 2023*  
Stories of the authors experiences working with survivors of brain injuries. The books follows several characters and shares Platt-Mill's experiences supporting them and the many challenges that they face. 

### The Right Stuff, Tom Wolfe
*Jan 2023*  
Following the men who became the Astronauts. Why were these men willing to take on the risks involved in strapping into a rocket? What sort of person did it take?

### Rain Dogs, Adrian McKinty
*Jan 2023*  
A good detective story set in N. Ireland during the Troubles. Suitably easy reading whilst on holiday.

### Winners: And how they succeed, Alastair Campbell
*Feb 2023*  
Objective, strategy, tactics. Enjoyed his parallels between sport and other walks of life.

### Running with the Kenyans, Adharanand Finn
*Feb 2023*  
Move to Iten (Kenya), run higher mileage, get faster. I was surprised at how recent this book is, I had always assumed it was a 'classic'. 

### Freezing Order, Bill Browder
*Mar 2023*  
A sequel to Red Notice which is no less thrilling. Mr Browder has powerful enemies. I expect publishing books to gain support of Western populations is a key part of his security strategy.

### No Surrender, Hiroo Oneda
*Mar 2023*  
Deployed in 1944 and instructed to fight a guerilla war, Oneda-san spends 30yrs on a Phillipine Island fighting. Remarkable endurance and willpower.
