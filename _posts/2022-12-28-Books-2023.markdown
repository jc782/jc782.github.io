## Summary:
My goal for 2023 is to read 24 books, with the stretch target of 36 books. Having only read 6 fiction books in 2022, I'd like to increase this to at least 10. 

### Run, Swim, Throw, Cheat: The Science behind drugs in sport, Chris Cooper
*Jan 2023*  
A little technical but it gave an insight into possible future methods of doping, and it seems there are several fruitful avenues to keep cheats busy. The discussion around bans for recreational drugs, and drugs that offer little genuine advantage is something I would agree with. 

### Tell me the planets: Stories of brain injuries and what it means to survive, Ben Platts-Mills
*Jan 2023*  
Stories of the authors experiences working with survivors of brain injuries. The books follows several characters and shares Platt-Mill's experiences supporting them and the many challenges that they face.
