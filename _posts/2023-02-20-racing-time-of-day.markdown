description: Why we should race later in the day?

I've raced at a lot of BMC events. They're fantastic. Paced races for a wide range of standards, several opportunities each year, and a supportive environment. The BMC's stated goal is to 'improve the world standing of UK Middle Distance Running'. One way I believe we can enable faster times at BMC events is by racing later in the day. Why? Better conditions. 

Starting anecdotally, there are many occasions, Watford Grand Prix's and Gold Standards stick in my mind most vividly, where after the conclusion of the races I'll walk back to the car and it seems like conditions have finally settled to perfection. Looking at data backs this up. First we can plot the average wind speed against the time of day and split by month. Since races are typically in the afternoon and evening, and in summertime, the ranges are limited to 3pm to 11pm and May to September.

This dataset is for a particular station in Coventry and looks at every day from the last decade. The drop in the average wind speed between 6pm and 8pm is significant.

Looking at it another way, the heatmap below shows the probability that the wind speed is below 7pm at a given time of day in each month. Take for example July. Running at 3pm there is a 12% chance the wind will be below 7mph. By 9pm the probability of wind <7mph has jumped up to 35% and it continues to improve, reaching 40% at 11pm. 

This chart also shows us a preference for better conditions later in the year. August and September give fine settled weather in the evenings far more frequently than May and June.

A secondary benefit of racing later is the drop in temperature. Particularly for longer races lower temperature can help performance. 

So what should we do? 
1. Run the races you want to prioritize the most after 8pm, ideally after 9pm
2. Plan to race into August and September for the best chance of good conditions.
