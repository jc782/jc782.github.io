description: Why we should race later in the day?

I've raced at a lot of BMC events. They're fantastic. Paced races for a wide range of standard, several opportunities each year, and a supportive environment. Anecdotally, after many of these races, Watford Grand Prix's and Gold Standard events stick most vividly in my mind, on the stroll back to the car the conditions have settled to perfection. Typically those who've raced earlier bemoan the windier conditions they had faced.

The BMC's stated goal is to 'improve the world standing of UK Middle Distance Running'. Most often at the BMC this means running faster times, typically with the goal of qualification times for e.g. British Championship or English Schools. One way I believe we can enable faster times at BMC events is by racing later in the evening. Why? Better conditions. Significantly less windy and, as a bonus, cooler. The rest of this article sets out evidence for this and makes recommendations to encourage faster races. 

High winds have at least two effects on races. First, it's fundamentally slower. The energy a runner spends battling a headwind is not equally compensated with the equivalent tailwind later in the lap. There is literature on the impact of wind speed in the sprint events such as the 100m. The first plot shows the time delta expected for various wind speeds and it clear that this is not symmetric. A 6m/s headwind is far more detrimental (~-0.6s) than a 6m/s tailwind is beneficial (~+0.25s).

Fighting into the wind is hard, and most people don't voluntarily do so. This leads to the secondary effect where races become tactical affairs as everyone avoids being the rabbit. Who wants to be the one that does all the work such that everyone else is rewarded? With dedicated pacemakers the BMC does mitigate this, but pacers will drop out around half way, the exact point it is key to push the pace on. 

While anecdotes are interesting, hard facts are better when it comes to making informed decisions. So let's take a look at some historic wind speed date. Luckily there is an abundance of data available from weather stations in the UK.

Since races are typically in the afternoon and evening, and in summertime, let's start by looking at the average wind speed between the times of 3pm to 11pm and in the months May to September. For each month we can plot what the average wind time is at that time of day. This dataset is for a particular station in Coventry, and contains data covering the last decade.

Okay, good, the drop in the average wind speed between 6pm and 8pm is significant.

Plotted another way, which is perhaps more useful. The heatmap below shows the probability that the wind speed is below 7mph at a given time of day in each month. Take for example July. Running at 3pm there is a 12% chance the wind will be below 7mph. By 9pm the probability of wind <7mph has jumped up to 35% and it continues to improve, reaching 40% at 11pm. 

This chart also shows us a preference for better conditions later in the year. August and September give fine settled weather in the evenings far more frequently than May and June.

A secondary benefit of racing later is the drop in temperature. Particularly for longer races lower temperature can help performance.

So, what can we learn from this. 
1. Prioritize races after 8pm, ideally after 9pm, when a fast time is the main goal.
2. Plan to race into August and September for the best chance of good conditions.
