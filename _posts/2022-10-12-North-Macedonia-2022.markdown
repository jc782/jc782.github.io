With the pandemic retreating in the rear view mirror options for travel to the more remote corners has become possible again. In October 2022 for the annual 'adventure' trip we packed bikes and hopped on a Wizz Air flight to Skopje, capitol of North Macedonia. We were unusually well prepared. This included a booking for a motel to stay in after the late flight (no more airport sleeping), a defined route mapped out, and our own reliable bikes with decent brakes and gears. 

Skopje airport was a wonderful experience. We cleared immigration in minutes and our bikes were already waiting for us. At 4am we reassembled them and rode the 5km to the motel. 

### Day 1
Torrential rain. Not a good start. For the worst of it we sheltered in a restaurant for a late breakfast and at midday as it cleared a first 20km of flat roads to Skopje was quickly covered. After sorting the usual essentials (new helmet to replace the one left in Luton, sim card, lunch) the road turned uphill. The initial steep ascent led to a more gradual climb up toward the Jassen natural park. 50km later we reached our first high-point and were eager to descend the 10km to the Matka canyon dam and pitch for the night. Sadly Macedonian military had other ideas. The road through Jassen is closed to bikes. Bugger. 

Instead we reversed back toward Skopje and pitched in a copse by the viewpoint of the canyon. A four hour thunderstorm engulfed the tent and by morning a dog had eaten our food stowed in a bag hanging in a nearby tent. 

### Day 2
The closed road meant a hefty diversion. Back to Skopje and around the north to Tetovo and Gostivar. Eager to make progress toward the hills we rode hard and after an excellent pizzaria lunch made good time down the valley in the western side of the country. As the road began to climb the sun was setting and we stopped (also at a pizzaria) for the day.

### Day 3
Our overnight stop was on the edge of Mavrovo national park. After an hour winding through the trees where the locals were carefully collecting chestnuts we emerged to the entrance archway. Mavrovi Anovi was a small village on the shore of the reservoir and was a nice stopping point for second breakfast. Mavrovo and Jassen are both national parks, but luckily Mavrovo welcomes mountain bikes and we followed a marked trail for 40km up to the Mavrovo ski resort and over to the next valley. It was a mixture of quiet mountain roads and doubletrack. 

After a quick descent we then decided to take the road to Novak which involved several more hairpins. Day 3 was the biggest climbing day on the bike. It was on the way to Novak we tried to register with the police (for the third time) and were unsucessful due to being outside the 24hr window. We barely grazed the lower houses of Novak deciding to push further on to the valley, and once in the valley then storming a final hour in darkness to reach Struga on the shores of Lake Ohrid. 

### Day 4
We were rewarded for the push to Struga firstly by successful registration with the police thanks to extremely helpful hosts at the airport, and secondly by a glorious morning drinking Italian coffee and looking out over Lake Ohrid. Supposedly the oldest and deepest in Europe.

By Day 4 we'd decided a 'rest' day had been earnt. Our next goal was to climb Mt Korab and so we followed the easy roads down the valley to Dubar covering 50km by lunchtime. From Dubar we tracked gently up the next valley, had a leisurely late lunch with some Macedonian food, and then traipsed the final 12km offroad up to the starting point for the climb of Korab. 

### Day 5
Overnight on the mountain was cold. Condensatation on the tent froze solid. Despite best intentions our alpine start was a more casual 8:30 when we left camp and followed the trail to Korab. It took 2.5hrs to cover the 9km up to the summit. From the top the views over Albania were stunning, whilst Macedonia has a lower cloud covering giving it an atmospheric feel. Mt Korab is one of only 5 mountains to be the highest peak in two countries. I wonder if anyone has climbed all 5. Two of the others are Everest and Mt Blanc and the final two are obscure peaks in Africa.

We were back to camp by lunchtime and packed the bikes for the ride back to civilisation. The 12km back to the mainroad was fun, albeit quite slow since it was off-road. Rejoining the main road we followed it back to Mavrovi Anovi  and then retraced our steps. Keen to camp again we had dinner in a pizzaria and then plugged away for 30mins in the dark to get out of town.

### Day 6
This was probably the best MTB of the trip. A climb on doubletrack led us to an awesome trail which was fairly flat and wound its way along the side of the mountain range. The views were spectacular. Unfortunatley we were on a schedule to get back to Skopje that day and so the MTB section was cut short and we descended to the much faster roads and followed those back through Tetovo to Skopje.

Skopje itself was intriguing. The city is split by the Zadar river and the vibe is very different depending which side of this natural border you are. The Warrior on a Horse statue was cool. 

### Day 7
It took much longer than expected to source bike boxes for the return trip but eventually a shop gave us two 29-er boxes. The bus from Skopje to the airport was a treat.

A word of warning - don't try to take bike tools through Skopje airport handluggage. They will be confiscated and you may then end up with a sketch ride out of luton airport where no bolts have been tightened.
