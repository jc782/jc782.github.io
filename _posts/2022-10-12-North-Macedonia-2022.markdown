With the pandemic a distant memory the option for travel to the more remote locations is again possible. So, the 2022 annual 'adventure' was to North Macedonia. We packed our bikes and hopped on a Wizz Air flight to the capital, Skopje. Our preparation was unprecedented. We had booked a motel to stay in after the late flight arrival (no more airport sleeping), had mapped out a comprehensive route, and brought reliable bikes with decent disc brakes. 

Arrival at Skopje airport was a wonderful experience. We cleared immigration in minutes and our bikes were already waiting for us. At 4am we reassembled our steeds and rode the 5km to our motel.   

### Day 1
We woke to torrential rain. Not a good start. As ever the inclements are no barrier and so we found a restaurant to enjoy a casual late breakfast and the first of many Macedonian coffee stops. By midday it was clearing and we tackled the first 20km of flat roads into Skopje in good time. Skopje was well equiped for sorting a few essentials (new helmet to replace the one left in Luton airport, sim card, lunch) and we were soon on our way out to the hills. The initial steep ascent led to a more gradual climb up toward the Jasen natural park. 50km later we reached our the road's summit and were eagerly anticipating the descent into the Matka canyon to the dam where we would pitch for the night. Sadly Macedonian military had other ideas. The road through Jasen is closed to bikes, 'Thou shall not pass', said Mr Macedonian military.

Slightly dejected we went back toward Skopje and pitched in a copse near the viewpoint of the canyon. A four hour thunderstorm engulfed us minutes after pitching and by morning a dog had eaten our food stowed in a bag hanging in a nearby tent. Not the best first day. The view the following morning was partial compensation.

### Day 2
The 'Jasen incident' meant a hefty diversion. Back to Skopje, then north to Radusha before heading up a wide valley where we passed through Tetovo and Gostivar. Eager to make progress toward the hills we rode quite fast with few stops, though we did find an excellent pizzaria lunch (also the first of many). It was the fuel we needed on a long day. After leaving Gostivar the road began to climb and the sun had set behind the hills. We stopped in Vrutok (also at a pizzaria) for the day happy that we had made up some of the lost time from the diversion.

### Day 3
Vrutok is nestled at the edge of Mavrovo national park. It took an hour on doubletrack winding up through the trees, watching the locals were preciously collecting chestnuts, to reach the National Park entrance. Shortly afterwards we found ourselves in Mavrovi Anovi. This small village, on the shore of the reservoir, was a nice stopping point for second breakfast and coffee. Mavrovo and Jasen are both national parks, but luckily Mavrovo is much more welcoming to mountain bikes. We followed a marked trail for 40km which went up to the Mavrovo ski resort and then over to the next valley. It was a mixture of quiet mountain roads and doubletrack and was lovely riding.

After a quick descent we then took the road to Novak which was a shorter but much hillier route to Lake Ohrid. There were several more hairpins, and Day 3 was the biggest climbing day on the bike. It was on the way to Novak we tried to register with the police (as is 'required') and were unsucessful due to being outside the 24hr window.

After grazing the lower slopes of Novak the road quickly descended to the Black Drin river. Once we were in the valley a tailwind encouraged us to storm a final hour in darkness to reach the shores of Lake Ohrid. 

### Day 4
Our push to Lake Ohrid, specifically the town of Struga, was rewarded first by successful registration with the police thanks to an extremely helpful hotel and second by a glorious morning drinking sipping Italian coffee and gazing over Lake Ohrid. It is supposedly the oldest and deepest in Europe.

By Day 4 we'd decided a 'rest' day had been earnt. Especially since our next goal was to climb Mt Korab, the highest peak in North Macedonia. Choosing the direct route we retraced our path down the valley to Debar, covering 50km by lunchtime. From Debar the road re-entered Mavrovo National Park and started a gradual climb.We had leisurely late lunch at a lovely roadside Macedonian restaurant and then traipsed the final 12km offroad up to the starting point for the climb of Korab.

### Day 5
Overnight on the mountain was cold, cold enough that the condensatation on the tent froze solid. Despite our best intentions of an alpine start it was a more casual 8:30 when we left camp, following the trail to Mt Korab.

It took 2.5hrs to cover the 9km up to the summit and the route was easy to follow. Mt Korab is also the highest peak in Albania and the views into Albania were stunning and cloud free. Meanwhile Macedonia had scattered and atmospheric cloud covering. Mt Korab is one of only 5 mountains to be the highest peak in two countries. I wonder if anyone has climbed all 5. Two of the others are Everest and Mt Blanc and the final two are obscure peaks in Africa.

We were back to camp by lunchtime and packed the bikes for the ride back to civilisation. The 12km back to the mainroad was fun, albeit quite slow since it was off-road. Rejoining the main road we followed it up to Mavrovi Anovi  and then down to Vrutok. Keen to camp again, we had dinner in a pizzaria in Vrutok and then plugged away for 30mins in the dark to get out of town and pitched at the side of the road.

### Day 6
This was probably the best MTB of the trip. A long doubletrack climb led to an awesome patt which was fairly flat and wound its way along the side of the mountain range. The views were spectacular. Unfortunately we were on a schedule to get back to Skopje that day and so the MTB section was cut short and we descended to the much faster roads and followed those back through Tetovo to Skopje.

Skopje itself was intriguing. The city is split by the Zadar river and the vibe is very different depending which side of this natural border you are. The Warrior on a Horse statue was cool. 

### Day 7
It took much longer than expected to source bike boxes for the return trip but eventually a shop gave us two 29-er boxes. To kill time I got a Macedonian haircut and we wandered the Old Bazaar. The bus from Skopje to the airport was easy and had ample luggage space for bikes.

A word of warning - don't try to take bike tools through Skopje airport handluggage. They will be confiscated and you may then end up with a sketchy ride out of luton airport where no bolts have been tightened. 

### Reflections
* First up, the government website advises registration with the police within 24hrs. We would have had no issues if we didn't register. However, the process was fairly easy and next time I would book a reputable hotel on the first night and sort registration then. 
* Macedonian people were all kind and the country felt safe. The roads were extremely quiet and well paved. 
* Our route ended up scattered, but I am confident that a loop could be completed. We rode ~70% on paved roads, but there were plenty of good off-road routes that could be explored.
