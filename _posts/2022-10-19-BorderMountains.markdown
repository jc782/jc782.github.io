Recently I climbed Mt Korab, the highest mountain in North Macedonia. Simultaneously, it is the highest mountain in Albania. This got me thinking, how many other mountains are the highest peak in multiple countries. Read on to find out.

Using [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_elevation_extremes_by_country) as the source there are 5:
|Mountain|Countries|Elevation|
|--------|-------|---------|
|Everest|China & Nepal|8848m|
|Mount Stanley|Uganda & DRC|5109m|
|Mont Blanc|France & Italy|4820m|
|Mont Nimba|Ivory Coast and Guinea|1752m|

So there you have it. I'm surprised it's so few given the nature of mountain ranges as borders.
