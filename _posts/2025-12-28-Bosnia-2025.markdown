The 2025 J&J trip was booked for November, slotted after summer holidays and antenatal classes. With the short days and cold weather, we elected to credit card tour, and for the first time ever did not take a tent. We are getting soft. 

We wanted to bike tour, and had worked out a chap we could buy bikes from in Sarajevo, however, the quality was dubious. Dubbed 'shimango' by a more serious bike shop. 

**Day 1**
After an early flight and a taxi into Sarajevo, we had a coffee in the square. On one hand, very clean and pleasant, and on the other shocked by the remaining scars from the war in the 90s. Deserted buildings and shell holes were never far away.

We collected bikes from our dude, and then booked a hotel out toward the mountains. The weather was cool but nice, blue skies and no problem in a t-shirt in the sun. The hotel seemed to cater mainly for business travel, we could not find the spa but we did use the swimming pool. The food, as continued through the holiday, was mediocre. At least the beer was cheap, at around £1 per pint.

**Day 2**
On our first proper day we set off toward the mountains, following the bikepacking highline Bosnia route. Unfortunately we were plagued with shimango bike issues, primarily a loosening square taper crank. Despite several useful garages tightening this, it never managed to remain tight. We made it through Hadzici and then to the 'last food shop' at Tarcin where we had lunch. After this the route climbed steeply, but nearing the top of the road it was clear that we should divert toward more civilization. There was a lack of accommodation on the route, and with the dodgy bikes it was slow progress. We decided to aim for Konjic and enjoyed a long descent into the town where we had a basic apartment booked.

**Day 3**
With the bike issues, we decided to try some hiking. The nearby peak of Zelena Glava looked a good challenge. The plan was to cycle to the trailhead, hike the mountain, and cycle back. A Zelena day trip. The locals, perhaps a little scared of the mountains, suggested it was too late in the season and could be cold and snowy, but with a good forecast we decided to go for it. 

As is typical, we did not start as early as planned, and had further troubles cycling to the trailhead when I snapped a square taper crank. We ditched the bikes and hitched the final few miles to start the hike.

The mountain itself was stunning, with the initial climb on a great double track path, then onto a stream bed, before finally reaching a typical single track. We almost turned around due to daylight, but as we neared the top we caught up with the early risers and decided to push on. The final climb included a little scrambling, but with the cables available it was not too challenging.

On the descent we chanced accross a couple of Serbians who were driving back through Konjic, and gave us a lift saving a 10km walk in the dark. Our bikes, it seems, were stolen at the side of the road.

**Day 4**
Bikes stolen and hiking completed, we went on the train down to Mostar. The train journey was stunning, along the river and lake side, and with a view up toward Zelena Glava where we had been the day before. Mostar itself was quite tourist heavy, so we hike up the mountain outside Mostar to get a view of the city.

I'm not sure you'd call it a highlight, but we took a look around the abandoned sniper tower, which was used during the war as a sniper hide. They don't try too hard to keep you out, and the graffiti on the inside is cool. It is several stories high, and gives a great view of the city.

We took advantage of the darkness to head back to Sarajevo on the train.

**Day 5**

We started the day with a visit to the 1984 Bobsled track. More abandoned structure exploration. This was super cool, and I'd love to go back and ride down it on a bike.

We then hit some of the Sarajevo tourist spots, including the site of the 1914 assassination of Franz Ferdinand which kicked off WW1 and set the course for the 20th century.
