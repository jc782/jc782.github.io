My chromebook has been EOL'd and my laptop is just too old to be suitable for use. So I've updated to an Acer Aspire 5. The reason for the choice was:
* Reasonable price point with good performance (Ryzen 4500u)
* Upgradeable RAM (seemingly the only option with the UK with upgradeable RAM at this price-point)
* Decent build / feel

Things I didn't care about include:
* Screen quality 
* Battery life

It is running dual booting Windows and Ubuntu 20.04 with the 5.8 kernel. Everything seems to be working so far with Ubuntu. It runs smoothly and quiet under normal operation.

The laptop feels solid and for a 15" screen it's suprisingly small and light.

The first upgrade should be adding an additional 16GB RAM stick.
