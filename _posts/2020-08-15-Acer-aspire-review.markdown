My chromebook has been EOL'd and my laptop is just too old to be suitable for use. So I've updated to an Acer Aspire 5. Reason for choice:
* Reasonable price point with good performance (Ryzen 4500u)
* Upgradeable RAM (seemingly the only option with the UK with upgradeable RAM at this price-point)
* Decent build / feel - The laptop feels solid and for a 15" laptop it's suprisingly small and light.
* Available now rather than in 6wks+
* My previous laptop was an Acer Aspire and has lasted 8yrs... so it seems like a good choice


Things I didn't care about and so compromised on:
* Screen quality 
* Battery life

Things that irk me so far:
* RAM is not 3200MHz
* Not a proper set of arrow keys
* Charge connector feels flimsy and is a frustrating way for a laptop to fail if it does. No option for USB-C charging
* Speakers are poor quality [fine with headphones]

I am dual booting Windows and Ubuntu 20.04 with the 5.8 kernel. Most things seems to work out of the box with Ubuntu. It runs smoothly and quiet under normal operation.
* Fn keys seem to not be bound to the Fn key

Jan 2021 Update:
* I had issues with audio reliablitly on 20.04 and generally felt a few things were not quite right. I have update to 20.10 Pop OS which seems smoother and the audio works. 

Feb 2021 Update:
* POP OS has generally been pretty good. Occasionally something happens which makes things run slow until I reboot. Unsure what this is. I also regret turning on encryption which seems like just an extra password to remember.
