## Altitude Training

This week I have become one of the many UK athletes who has made the pilgrimage to Font Romeu for some altitde gainz. Time constraints mean that my trip bucks conventional wisdom to spend inordinate amounts of time at altitude. But is it still possible to reap some of the benefit? 

Font isn't that high, only ~1500m, and this has probably helped for a short trip. I've not had headaches or any other signs of altitude sickness which has made it possible to crack straight on with hard training. 

There are 3 main ways people altitude train.
1.) Live high, train high
2.) Live high, train low
3.) Live low, train high

At the moment 1 and 2 seem to be the most popular. But, based on no evidence and a complete lack of physiological understanding, I think 3 is best suited to runners. Or some combination of 1 and 3. Why?

The main limiting factor for me training at home is that on steady/easy days my legs are damaged from sessions which limits the pace I run at, and limits how hard the cardiovascular system is working. The point of these easy/steady runs is to build endurance, and to help recover for the next session.

Taking the same run from low altitude (say 6 miles @7min pace) and running that at 1500m means the impact on the legs is equivalent but the cardiovascular system has had to work harder. For the same training load on the legs there is a larger training load on the lungs.
