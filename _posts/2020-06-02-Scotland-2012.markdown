*Historical post written up during the coronavirus lockdown for posterity*

2012 was adventure trip #3, post A-levels. The formula built upon the previous year. Good things carried forward included the megabus / megatrain deals to get us to Aviemore dirt cheap and the target location. Things improved were:
* Tent upgrade to something suitable for high winds
* Significant improvement in packing to reduce pack weight, involving detailed calculations on optimal foods by kcal/100g.

The exact route details are hazy, but I believe we walked from Aviemore down to Glen Feshie, over Carn-ban-mor and down to Loch Einich, then around the bottom into the Lairig Ghru then looped over Braeriach and Cairn Toul before a retreat in bad weather to Glenmore. The route was then picked up over Cairngorm, the Macdui plateau, and back out over the feshie hills.

Notable moments included finally reaching the summit of Braeriach, the 'wotsits' in the Lairig ghru, football at Glenmoor lodge, wild-swimming in the lochs. It must have rained a lot this year, there's a lack of photos except for what was one of the best wild camping spots I think ever.
