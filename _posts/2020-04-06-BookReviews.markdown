## Summary:

This year (2020) I am attempting to read more. To keep track I'm listing the books I've read here along with short comment and notable takeaways.

### The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes
*Mar 2020*  
Really liked this book. It's incredible the progress to realise the progress made between 1900 and 1945. That the developed two different bombs in parallel was new to me. The final chapters on the devastation hit hard.

### Longitude, Dava Sobel
*April 2020*  
The battle of a master craftsman and innovater to be recognised for astonishing work on developing accurate clocks was astonishing. 

### 24 Hours at Agincourt, Michael Jones
*January 2020*  
Henry was a great leader, and war was business.

### Shoe Dog, Phil Knight
*April 2020*  
From concept to IPO, the story of NIKE. It's interesting to see change in how NIKE are now viewed from a grassroots level in the athletics community. 

### Antifragile, Nicholas Talib
*May 2020*  
Give yourself optionality.
