## Summary:

This year (2020) I am attempting to read more. To keep track I'm listing the books I've read here along with short comment and notable takeaways. In no particular order.

### The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes
*Mar 2020*  
It's incredible the progress to realise the progress made between 1900 and 1945 with physics. That the developed two different bombs in parallel was new to me. The suckerpunch describing the devastation was akin to the finale of Blackadder goes forth. 

### Longitude, Dava Sobel
*April 2020*  
The battle of a master craftsman and innovater to be recognised for astonishing work on developing clocks was astonishing. 

### 24 Hours at Agincourt, Michael Jones
*January 2020*  
Henry was a great leader, and war was business.

### Shoe Dog, Phil Knight
*April 2020*  
From creation to IPO, the story of NIKE. It's interesting to see change in how NIKE are now viewed from a grassroots level in the athletics community. 

### Antifragile, Nicholas Talib
*May 2020*  
Give yourself optionality.

### Daemon, Daniel Suarez
*May 2020*  
Fiction for a world being taken over by a daemon invoked upon the death of a games company founder. An eye into the importance of digital security.

### Freedom, Daniel Suarez
*June 2020* 
Sequel to Daemon. Unfortunately not as good as the first; felt lacklustre throughout and insufficiently interesting to be a page-turner.

### Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden
*May 2020*
Other than my initial misconceptions that Black Hawk Down was just a film, this was a really great story.

### Turn the Ship Around, David Marquet 
*January 2020*
Leader-Follower to Leader-Leader. Invest and believe in people. 

### The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner
*April 2020*
The number of inventions generated by Bell labs was phenomenal. The investment in basic research feels like it created more value than current VC funding of software companies. 

### Ignition, Kevin Anderson
*April 2020*
Fictional story of terrorist attacks on Nasa rocket launches being thwarted by an injured astronaut in the (wrong) right place at the right time.

### As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, Laurie Lee
*May 2020*
Laurie Lee goes on a colourful adventure tramping through first southern England then Spain. He experiences the outbreak of civil war; the hardship of poorer classes in the 30s is sobering.

### Trouble with Lichen, John Wyndham
*May 2020*
Fiction tale about the discovery of 'antigerones' to extend life. Some interesting ethical considerations...

### Never Split the Difference, Chris Voss
*May 2020*
I think this book will pay for itself many times over.

### The Map that Changed the World, Simon Winchester
*June 2020*
The story of William Smith traipsing around England and mapping the strata. Much more readable than I expected and enjoyable. Surveyor in the early 1800s sounded fun.

### Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race, Renni Eddo-Lodge
*June 2020*
There is a problem and I'm part of it. I was hoping for more actionable points at the end of the book.

### The Drunkard's Walk, Leonard Mlodinow
*July 2020*
Statistics is necessarily intuitive so do the math. 

### The Narrow Road To The Deep North, Richard Flanagan
*July 2020*
Fictional tale about the horrors in a Japanese PoW camp and following the later lives of those involved.

### Bad Blood, John Carreyrou
*August 2020*
[Audio book] - The tale of Theranos. Stunning account of lies, deceipt, and groupthink leading to the rise and fall Theranos. 


### Everest The First Ascent: The untold story of Griffith Pugh, Harriet Tuckey
*August 2020*
A great story of the success of evidence driven experimentation. Includes high altitude physiological research leading to success on Everest. Also reapplied to the Mexico City Olympic games.

### The Men who United the States, Simon Winchester
*August 2020*  
A sweeping tale of America's development. Canals, roads, rail, the internet. My favourite section was a scam surrounding planted gems solved by geologist Clarence King.
