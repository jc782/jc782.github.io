## Summary:

This year (2020) I am attempting to read more. To keep track I'm listing the books I've read here along with short comment and notable takeaways. In no particular order.

### The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes
*Mar 2020*  
It's incredible the progress to realise the progress made between 1900 and 1945 with physics. That the developed two different bombs in parallel was new to me. The suckerpunch describing the devastation was akin to the finale of Blackadder goes forth. 

### Longitude, Dava Sobel
*April 2020*  
The battle of a master craftsman and innovater to be recognised for astonishing work on developing clocks was astonishing. 

### 24 Hours at Agincourt, Michael Jones
*January 2020*  
Henry was a great leader, and war was business.

### Shoe Dog, Phil Knight
*April 2020*  
From creation to IPO, the story of NIKE. It's interesting to see change in how NIKE are now viewed from a grassroots level in the athletics community. 

### Antifragile, Nicholas Talib
*May 2020*  
Give yourself optionality.

### Daemon, Daniel Suarez
*May 2020*  
Fiction for a world being taken over by a daemon invoked upon the death of a games company founder. An eye into the importance of digital security.

### Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden
*May 2020*
Other than my initial misconceptions that Black Hawk Down was just a film, this was a really great story.

### Turn the Ship Around, David Marquet 
*January 2020*
Leader-Follower to Leader-Leader. Invest and believe in people. 

### The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner
*April 2020*
The number of inventions generated by Bell labs was phenomenal. The investment in basic research feels like it created more value than current VC funding of software companies. 

### Ignition, Kevin Anderson
*April 2020*
Fictional story of terrorist attacks on Nasa rocket launches being thwarted by an injured astronaut in the (wrong) right place at the right time.

### As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, Laurie Lee
*May 2020*
Laurie Lee goes on a colourful adventure tramping through first southern England then Spain. He experiences the outbreak of civil war; the hardship of poorer classes in the 30s is sobering.

### Trouble with Lichen, John Wyndham
*May 2020*
Fiction tale about the discovery of 'antigerones' to extend life. Some interesting ethical considerations...

### Never Split the Difference, Chris Voss
*May 2020*
I think thi book will pay for itself many times over.
