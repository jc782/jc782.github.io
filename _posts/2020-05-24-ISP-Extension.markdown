<div markdown="1" class="contentCont" id="scroll">
Time trial bikes are expensive. A friend was offered one at mates rates with a frustrating problem; it had an integrated seat post and he was taller than the previous rider.

No matter, carbon is an friendly material for rework, so we decided the best and the proper fix was to extend the seatpost with fresh carbon. After some measurements it looked like we needed to add approximately 3" additional height.
