description: Vac Bag Setup

I'm working toward a new project which involves some composite layup. Previous projects I've done have suffered for a lack of a decent vacuum bagging setup. I've come up with a fairly low-cost option which also doesn't need too much space.

* Parts
- 12V Vacuum Pump (you'll need something)
- Passive Vacuum switch
- Vacuum bagging connector
- Various barb/fittings

I think the key realisation here was that I could get hold of a relatively cheap part which passively switches on/off depending on the vacuum. This means the pump doesn't need to run at 100% duty (which it certainly isn't rated for).

An upgrade that may be necessary is a vacuum reservoir - first tests should be in the next few weeks so we'll see.

For the ultra-budget vacuum bagger, a 3d printed connector is also an option.
