We are getting married next year. As an unnecessary extra I have setup a [website](https://joshandemma.info/) to enable easy RSPV and also such that people can remember and easily access details. Also, with free hosting and a cheap domain name (<Â£5 for a year) it's basically free.  

It's a simple site. I started from another one that I found. It's a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site. Compared to Jekyll that this site runs on I was pleasantly surprised at how fast the Hugo site would rebuild. 

I am hosting it on Github Pages (free!)

The RSPV form is a google form with the front end on this website, using [this](https://blog.puvvadi.me/posts/add-contact-form-hugo-google-forms/) example. It was easy to setup. 

In other news, I also 3d scanned out venue and once I have modelled in the marquee in more detail then I will upload some renderings. This should help us with layouts and checking where everything will go.
