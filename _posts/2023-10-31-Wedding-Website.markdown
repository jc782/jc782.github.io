We are getting married next year. To provide our guests with up-to-date information I have set up a [website](https://joshandemma.info/)](https://joshandemma.info/). With free hosting (Github Pages) and a cheap domain name (<Â£5 for a year), it's basically free.  

It's a simple static site using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework.

The RSVP form is a Google form with the front end on this website, using [this](https://blog.puvvadi.me/posts/add-contact-form-hugo-google-forms/) example. It was easy to set up.

Please feel free to fork the site. The GitHub repo is [here](https://github.com/jc782/wedding-website)
