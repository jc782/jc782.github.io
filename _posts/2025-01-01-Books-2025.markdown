## Summary:
As per usual, I am aiming to read two books per month, with the caveat the life is busy!

### Around the World in 80 Games, Marcus Du Sautoy
*Jan 2025*  
Easy to dip in and out of, covering a few games each times. Generally covered by region / culture. Marcus explains the earliest games starting from Knuckle-bone dice all the way through to recent hits like Settlers of Catan.

### The Race to the Future: 8000 Miles To Paris, Kassia St Clair
*Jan 2025*  
This book tells the story of an automobile race from Peking (Beijing) to Paris in the early 1900s. A variety of 'cars' and a curious group of mostly wealthy entrants battle through China, Russia and Europe to demonstrate the capability of the automobile. I enjoyed the excerpts on the technology development of the time.

### The Longest Climb, Dominic Faulkner
*Mar 2025*  
Dominic and a group of intrepid explorers travel from the Red Sea to the Summit of Everest. The combination of long distance bike touring through Iran and Pakistan, immediately followed by high altitude mountaineering was challenging but ultimately very successful with many of the team summitting. 

### Close to Death, Anthony Horowitz
*Mar 2025*  
The next in the series of Hawthorn investigations. I enjoyed it.
