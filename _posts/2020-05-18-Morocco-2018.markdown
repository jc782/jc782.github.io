Morocco had been on the cards for a few years. Cheap flights and proximity to the UK making it an attractive destination. Given the success of 'winging it' in Kyrgyzstan, we decided to do the same again.

To get the proper experience of arriving in Marrakech we walked in from the airport; vaguely hoping we'd stumble across some bikes but alas it was not so easy.

After being shown to a Souk by some kids we haggled with a bike stall owner whereupon we agreed to meet him the following morning at 7am where he'd have assembled two bikes plus panniers for us ready to hit the road. The evening in Marakech was pleasant once the hastily booked Riad was located.

Bike man did not exactly deliver the goods. His suggested bikes were hopeless, and the ones we finally settled on not much better. I can't remember how much we paid, it probably wasn't very much, and yet it was definitely too much.

The Atlas mountains quickly become visible cycling south from the city. A mixture of dirt trails and larger paved roads plus the early start meant we made good progress to the foothills. There was a minor issue with bottom brackets loosening and a cross threaded pedal wearing out. At dusk we were informed by the police we couldn't start up the road to Oukaimeden, so instead carried on a short way hoping to find a spot to wild camp. A seemingly generous roadside man offered his garden and peppered us with food for the evening. Sadly they then requested an unreasonably large sum of money for 'the experience'. Luckily we didn't have much cash to give away It was a good lesson learnt to set the expectation early on.

Our friend from the evening had shared one gem with us though; that there had been early season snow and some skiing up at Oukaimeden might be possible. A pedal failure, short hitch hike, and then walk got us to the roadside sledge and ski rental at Morocco's premier ski resort. There was thin, but adaquate looking cover so we entered negotiations to rent skis for a few hours and hike up. I think we haggled them down from £40 initially to about £2 - which was critical since it was all the cash we had left after being swindled the previous night. It was £2 well spent for the experience, even if the snow was awful.

Post skiing a map assessment showed an offroad downhill route to Asni. The locals were apprensive about being able to cycle it, but we figured it would be doable so pitched up ready for an epic days riding.

Epic it was. Dirt trails winding their way down a few thousand meters. Squealing brakes and shoddy suspension serving us well. One bike of the bikes was down to just one pedal, but there's an awkward technique to pedal just pushing on the crank arm we learnt.

In Asni, frankly, we'd had enough of the bikes. Plus we really needed to find cash. It was a stroke of luck that a man saw us with the bikes and, weirdly without any prompting, asked to buy them from us. A bit too good to be true, and we were wary especially after the last few days, but it transpired to be entirely genuine and after buying the bikes he also helped sort a taxi to Imlil at 'local' rate rather that tourist rate.

Imlil is the base town for climbing Toubkal, the highest mountain in Western Africa. A good weather window meant we decided to have a crack. You can pay to be 'guided', but in summer conditions with previous mountain experience this isn't necessary. Given the recent snow we did hire some crampons. Typically the climb is done over 2 days, the first from Imlil up to the huts (there are 2), then the second to climb the final 1000m and descend. The route up is frequented by sellers of trinkets and drinks.

With an early start we had made it to the huts (whereupon we pitched the tent) in good time and pushed on to summit the same day. Our late summit meant we had it entirely to ourselves. At 4167m it was an altitude pb - shorts and t-shirt on the summit is testament to how good the weather was.
