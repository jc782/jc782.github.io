description: Lifetime miles vs miles run sub-4
published: true
---

I've run about 26000miles I think. 20,000 are Strava recorded and I must have run at least another few thousand. I've run 1 complete mile in under 4 minutes. Pretty bad conversion of training miles to lifetime goal so I thought I'd see whether in a 26,000pixel image of green=outside 4mins and red = under 4mins whether it's possible to see the red one.

Can you spot it?
