In recent years I've been doing more business travel, and since I'm reluctant to give up running, this has meant I reasonably frequently find myself going for a run from an airport before catching a flight. I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality of running available nearby and the practical feasibility.

### San Francisco
When running from SFO I've typically taken the train to the Long Term Parking (free shuttle) and then head on the loop around Oyster Point. This is a nice trail, mostly asphalt, that hugs the bay. It's part of the San Francisco Bay Trail. Going all the way around Oyster Point and cutting back directly is approximately an 8mile run.

*Shower options:*
Neither the BA nor Alaska lounges have showers, but luckily the America Airlines Admirals lounge does.

### Seattle
It's possible to leave Seatac airport on foot. Within approximately 1 mile you can reach the upper end of Des Moines Creek Trail (which also hosts a parkrun!). The creek trail is lovely, all the way down to the Ocean / Bay / Fjord. The parkrun is challenging, with the first half solidly uphill before doing a U-Turn. I managed to sneak the CR on my visit. 

For a shorter run you can return back the same route, but for a longer (~17miles) you can continue north on the coast around Three Tree Point which has some nice views. 

*Shower options:*
The BA lounge has one (nice) shower. The Alaska lounge immediately after security did not. I have not checked

### Heathrow 
The running options from Heathrow are suprisingly good. From T5 you can leave on foot. From T2/T3 I don't think it's possible due to the tunnel. I went north and was quickly off-road, joining Harmondsworth Road. Since I ran in January and the underfoot conditions were wet, I decided it would be better to run on the road, and I followed the lane down to Sipson and Harlington, before returning on the boundary of the airport.

*Shower options:*
I believe all 3 T5 lounges have showers. I walked through the underground tunnel to the B gates since I think this is the most pleasant lounge.

### Paris Orly 
On a layover from Geneva to SFO I had 7hrs in Paris and went for a run. This is a small airport, so it was dead easy to exit on foot. The suburbs of Paris were mediocre, but I did manage to get down to the Seine for a while, which was nice.

*Shower options:*
Unfortunately this trip wasn't on Oneworld... and I don't think Orly has any lounges anyway. A family bathroom to a quick wipe down was the best I could do. Apologies to my neighbour on the longhaul flight.
