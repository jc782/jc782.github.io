## Summary:

I'd been mulling over a 2018 Japow ski trip for a few years, so when the idea of racing an Ekiden came along it was a no-brainer to tag on some days on the slopes. Japan's reputation for deep, light powder, especially on the north island of Hokkaido has become internationally renowned. We went to find out what it was all about.

## Logistics:

Our trip was a little over two weeks long and the plan was to spend the first 4 days in Tokyo and racing in the Okumusashi Ekiden at Hanno city. This left just under 2 weeks to explore Japan's skiing so we planned an itinary with four stops. This works perfectly with the south-east Hokkaido and East Japan rail pass which allows 6 days of travel on JR trains within a 14 day period. It includes travel on the Shinkansen and simply using it for Tokyo-Hakodate return makes the pass worthwhile. It also works nicely for people with their own skis as there's no extra charge for carrying them. We'd heard that it was frowned upon to carry large amounts of luggage but this was unavoidable for us and we didn't have any problems other than on the metro in Tokyo.

## Tokyo:

There is more than enough information on the internet about what to do in Tokyo so I'm not going to say much. It's a cool city. I much preferred it to NYC or SF despite understanding 0% of the language. There's not many options for runners other than Yoyogi park, but there are lots and lots of options for cheap noodles or curry.

## Yuzawa Resorts

Just 90mins on the bullet train from Tokyo station we arrived at Gala Yuzawa, the town of Yuzawa being the base for the first 4 days. The Shinkansen actually stops at the base station of the mountain which is cool but also means half of Tokyo goes skiing there at the weekend. If you do go at the weekend jump on one of the free shuttle buses and there are plenty of other resorts in this area that stay quiet.

### Yuzawa Kogen

Linked to Gala Yuzawa by a ropeway this is a small resort. We spent just one afternoon there and had skied everything within an hour. The steepest skiing is near the top but, like most of Japan, it's not too challanging. There is a cheap restaurant that does decent chicken and chips and an expensive restaurant that does pizza.

### Gala Yuzawa

Not much to say about Gala, we skied there on a Tuesday morning and it was pretty busy. The lift system is better than the other resorts nearby but also much busier because more people go to Gala. It was puking snow for the 4hrs we spent in the area so it's hard to fault the conditions, but I probably wouldn't go back to Gala.

### Ishiuchi Maruyama

Linked into the same lift system as Gala and Yuzawa Kogen this was definitely the best of the three. It felt like there was more vertical on offer, the average run was much steeper, it was easier to dive offpiste or between pistes and seemed to all count as inbounds, and best of all it was so quiet that we were skiing deep fresh powder at 6pm in floodlit conditions. (Nighta is a big thing in Japan!)

### Kandatsu Kogen

There's a free shuttle bus from Yuzawa station up to Kandatsu, it runs fairly regularly at the start and end of the day. The skiing is all in one big bowl, the lower more gentle slopes were great for blasting some big carved turns, and up higher there were pockets of tree skiing that were fun to loop. There was even one slope that would be a black in Europe. Sadly we went on a weekday when one of the chairlifts that accessed the best terrain wasn't running, but that didn't detract from a great day of skiing.

The other notable thing about Kandatsu was the abundance of bumps/moguls/zip lines. Most of the fresh was tracked out, but I had a lot of fun building up some lactic on the bumps.


### Zao Onsen

Train from Yuzawa back toward Tokyo, then up to Sendai and accross to Zao Onsen. The place stinks of sulphur but it does give it a certain atmosphere. We had an absolute bargain here staying at Christmas Lodge for 7pppn. Definitely worth trying out both the public onsen and a hotel/private one. The water is said to have healed Warriors in the past so it's good enough to sooth aching legs.

The skiing here was good, it felt fairly alpine with a few distinct areas that were connected (sort of) and some quicker chairlifts. On a blue sky day the views down the valley were incredible.

You can't mention Zao Onsen without talking about the Snow Monsters. I've never seen anything like it. The picture speaks for itself.

### Geto Kogen

Hands down this was the best skiing we had. It might be a small resort but I could happily have skied there for a week in the conditions we had. Arriving, there was only a few cm of snowfall forecast, but for the 48hrs we spent there is didn't stop snowing. You can stay right at the mountain in a capsule hotel half board for a very reasonable price. The spa including outdoor pool was great. The food was not but who cares when you've spent the day skiing waist deep powder through trees.

Geto Kogen has opened tree runs over the last few years. They've pruned the forest so you can hit any number of different lines down the mountain under the main gondala and still end up back at home. Even with only this gondala if it's snowing enough Geto is the place to be. I could write a whole post about how great this place was. Other than the food the only other downer was the lack of a free bus down to the Shink station before 5pm.

If you go to Japan and you just want to ski powder in trees on your own / with buddies then Geto is the place to be.

### Niseko

Finally on Hokkaido. We braved hiring a car for this part because our hotel was not near the slopes. Niseko is expensive, it's full of Aussie's, it does have good skiing and the lift infrastructure is better than anywhere else in Japan. But... I wouldn't go back. I'd rather try out more small resorts in Northern Honshu than listen to Aussie's brag about drinking lots the night before.


### Skiing Summary

Japan lived up to it's reputation. I think we skied 'deep' powder at least half of the days we were there. It's not as expensive as you might think (apart from Niseko), has amazing culture, great food in general, and unbeatable Onsens.
