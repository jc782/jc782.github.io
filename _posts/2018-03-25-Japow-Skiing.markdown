## Summary:

Ekiden racing, deep Japow, and daily onsens.

## Ekiden:

We took part in the Okumusashi Ekiden - an excellent experience and one well worth repeating. 6 legs along an out-and-back course along the Seibu-Ikebukoro line. Individually I had a mediocre run; as a team we finished 4th to some quality teams.

## Yuzawa Resorts

90mins on the bullet train from Tokyo station we arrived at Gala Yuzawa. The Shinkansen actually stops at the base station of the mountain which is cool. There's a collection of resorts in the area, some interlinked with lifts and others a shuttle bus away.

### Yuzawa Kogen

Linked to Gala Yuzawa by a ropeway this is a small resort. We spent just one afternoon there and had skied everything within an hour. The link to Gala Yuzawa was unfortunately closed. The steepest skiing is near the top but, like most of Japan, it's not too challenging. Note to self - they are not keen on people running up the piste.

### Gala Yuzawa

Not much to say about Gala, we skied there on a Tuesday morning and it was pretty busy. The lift system is better than the other resorts nearby but also much busier.

### Ishiuchi Maruyama

Linked into the same lift system as Gala and Yuzawa Kogen this was definitely the best of the three. It felt like there was more vertical on offer, the average run was much steeper, it was easier to dive offpiste or between pistes and seemed to all count as inbounds, and best of all it was so quiet that we were skiing deep fresh powder at 6pm in floodlit conditions. (Nighta is a big thing in Japan!)

Most incredible though were the pisteurs, who searched for a lost ski using obligatory metal detector after we'd given up.

The snow was falling quicker than we could ski it, so we stayed on late under the flood lights enjoying the Japanese tradition of 'Nighta'.

### Kandatsu Kogen

There's a free shuttle bus from Yuzawa station up to Kandatsu, it runs fairly regularly at the start and end of the day. The skiing is all in one big bowl, the lower more gentle slopes were great for blasting some big carved turns. Higher up there were pockets of tree skiing that were fun to loop. There was even one slope that would be a black in Europe.
Kandatsu was notable for the abundance of bumps/moguls/zip lines. The Japanese love their moguls - some kids outclassed me hammering down one line.


### Zao Onsen

More bullet train. First back toward Tokyo then up to Sendai and accross to Zao Onsen. The place stinks of sulphur. It's 'Atmospheric'. Both the public and private onsens were excellent. The water is said to have healed Warriors in the past so it's good enough to sooth aching post-ski legs.

The skiing here was good, it felt fairly alpine with a few distinct areas that were connected (sort of) and some quicker chairlifts. On a blue sky day the views down the valley were incredible.

You can't mention Zao Onsen without talking about the Snow Monsters. I've never seen anything like it. The picture speaks for itself.

### Geto Kogen

Hands down this was the best skiing we had. The forecast predicted a few mere cms of snow. but for the 48hrs we spent there it was dumping constantly. You can stay right at the mountain in a capsule hotel half board with the onsen included. The food was, uh, not great. Who cares when you've spent the day skiing waist deep powder through trees.

Geto Kogen has opened tree runs over the last few years. They've pruned the forest so you can hit any number of different lines down the mountain under the main gondala and still end up back at home. Even with only this gondala if it's snowing enough Geto is the place to be. I could write a whole post about how great this place was. Other than the food the only other downer was the lack of a free bus down to the Shinkansen station before 5pm. A nice employee gave us a lift.

If you go to Japan and you just want to ski powder in trees on your own / with buddies then Geto is the place to be.

### Niseko

Finally on Hokkaido. We hired a car for this part because our hotel was not near the slopes. Niseko is expensive, it's full of Aussie's, and they're all insufferable. It was an anticlimax after Geto.

### Sapporo

By coincidence we were in town at the time of the Ice Festival so spent a day in Sapporo. It came alive with the lightshow.

### Hakodate

Two memorable aspects to Hakodate. Our night time walk up to get the iconic view of the bay, and the monkey's in the onsen.

### Skiing Summary

Japan lived up to it's reputation. I think we skied 'deep' powder at least half of the days we were there. It's not as expensive as you might think (apart from Niseko), has amazing culture, great food in general, and unbeatable Onsens.

### Logistics:

We use the south-east Hokkaido and East Japan rail pass which allows 6 days of travel on JR trains within a 14 day period. It includes travel on the Shinkansen and using it for Tokyo-Hakodate return alone makes the pass economic. It also works nicely for people with their own skis as there's no extra charge for carrying them.

By flying with Air France we took skis + boot bags in place of normal luggage.
