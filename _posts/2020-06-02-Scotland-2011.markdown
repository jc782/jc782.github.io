*Historical post written up during the coronavirus lockdown for posterity*

2011 was #2 in the adventure series. Young and naive, the wilderness selected was the Cairngorms. I'm not sure exactly how, but the megabus deals were phenomenal and actually for Birmingham->Edinburgh on the train. 

Some mistakes were made in the planning of this trip. Ultralight wasn't a thing anywhere yet and it wasn't a thing on this trip. 

The route is preserved in history on a map from my Grandparents. It started with a climb up the Feshie hills.

At some point, we made it around the Lairig Ghru where bad weather pinned us down for a day camped at the old Sinclair hut site.

There's evidence of poor food planning. Non-dehydrated food is not a good idea for maximising kcal/100g.

The loop came down the back of Cairngorm which left a long walk on the flat back to Aviemore.

Look how young we were!

Highlights were:
* Cairngorm / over the Feshie Hills
* Deep-fried Mars bar
* KFC in Edinburgh

Lowlights were:
* Sausages outside Aviemore
* Tent inadequacies in high winds
