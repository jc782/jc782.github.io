*Historical post written up during the coronavirus lockdown for posterity*

2011 was #2 in the adventure series. Young and naive, the wilderness selected was the Cairngorms. I'm not sure exactly how, but the megabus deals were phenomenal and actually for Birmingham->Edinburgh on the train. 

Some mistakes were made in the planning of this trip. Ultralight wasn't really a thing anywhere and it definitely wasn't a thing on this trip. 

The route is preserved in history on a map from my Grandparents. It started with a climb up the feshie hills.

At some point we made it around the the lairig ghru where bad weather pinned us down for a day camped at the old Sinclair hut site.

There's evidence of the poor food planning. Non dehydrated food, not a good idea for kcal/100g.

The loop came down the back of cairngorm which left a long walk on the flat back to Aviemore.

Look how young we were!

Highlights were:
* Cairngorm / over the feshie hills
* Deep fried mars bar
* KFC in Edinburgh

Lowlights were:
* Sausages outside Aviemore
* Tent inadequacies in high winds
