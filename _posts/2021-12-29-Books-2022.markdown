## Summary:
So begins another year, once again 2 books / month is the target. I'd like, again, to read a few more classics and also more history. 

## Reading list:
* No surrender


### Good Data, Sam Gilbert
*Jan 2022*  
An optimist's guide to our digital future. A reasonable take on the legitimacy of big-tech and the value of data. Most interesting sections around the development of 'Bought by Many' and how they looked into this. 

### The Fell, Sarah Moss
*Jan 2022*  
An tale which captures well the zeitgeist of the COVID era. Enjoyed it and got the year off to a flying start.

### Mabel, Olive, and Me, Andrew Cotter
*Jan 2022*  
Bought this for Emma for Christmas, enjoyed it. Easy reading. Almost makes me want a labrador. 

### Born to Run, Christopher McDougall
*Feb 2022*  
The mix of adventure story and running made this a fun read. The Tarahumara clearly love their running. I agree with the points on foot strength being important, but I think it's hard with the Next% shoes nowadays to say that minimalism remains faster. 

### The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman
*Feb 2022*  
Marginally more academic than I expected but still readable. The later chapters around design fitting into a commercial environment were interesting. Amusingly I struggled with extracting a key from a hire car while reading this book; there was a subtle trick required. I blame the design.

### Under the Wig, William Clegg
*Mar 2022*  
In the same vein as the Secret Barrister. Quite interesting stories, especially in representing clients defending charges of war crimes.

### Empire of Pain, Patrick Keefe
*Mar 2022*  
Impressively complete story of the Sackler family and its role in the opoid crisis. Especially interesting in light of recent visit to SF, a city clearly struggling with this.
