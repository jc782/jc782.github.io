## Summary:
So begins another year, once again 2 books / month is the target. I'd like, again, to read a few more classics and also more history. 

## Reading list:
* No surrender


### Good Data, Sam Gilbert
*Jan 2022*  
An optimist's guide to our digital future. A reasonable take on the legitimacy of big-tech and the value of data. Most interesting sections around the development of 'Bought by Many' and how they looked into this. 

### The Fell, Sarah Moss
*Jan 2022*  
An tale which captures well the zeitgeist of the COVID era. Enjoyed it and got the year off to a flying start.

### Mabel, Olive, and Me, Andrew Cotter
*Jan 2022*  
Bought this for Emma for Christmas, enjoyed it. Easy reading. Almost makes me want a labrador. 

### Born to Run, Christopher McDougall
*Feb 2022*  
The mix of adventure story and running made this a fun read. The Tarahumara clearly love their running. I agree with the points on foot strength being important, but I think it's hard with the Next% shoes nowadays to say that minimalism remains faster. 

### The Design of Everyday Things, Don Norman
*Feb 2022*  
Marginally more academic than I expected but still readable. The later chapters around design fitting into a commercial environment were interesting. Amusingly I struggled with extracting a key from a hire car while reading this book; there was a subtle trick required. I blame the design.

### Under the Wig, William Clegg
*Mar 2022*  
In the same vein as the Secret Barrister. Quite interesting stories, especially in representing clients defending charges of war crimes.

### Empire of Pain, Patrick Keefe
*Mar 2022*  
Impressively complete story of the Sackler family and its role in the opoid crisis. Especially interesting in light of recent visit to SF, a city clearly struggling with this.

### The Lonely Skier, Hammond Innes
*Apr 2022*  
Took a long time for me to clock that this was fiction. Good read.

### Gironimo, Tim Moore
*Apr 2022*  
Our protagonist Tim Moore equips himself with a 1914 era bike, complete with reversible rear wheel to change gear, and proceeds to follow the brutal 1914 Giro route. The journey is arduous but not nearly as hard at the genuine 1914 edition. Those men were undeniably Hard.

### Swim, Bike, Run: Our Triathlon Story, A & J Brownlee
*Apr 2022*  
Astonishingly honest account of the Brownlees up till 2012. They did train exceedingly hard and they understood what was needed to 'win' triathlon. 

### Regions of the heart, David Rose & Ed Douglas
*May 2022*  
Biography of climber Alison Hargreaves who died on K2 in 1995. Tragically her son died in the Himalaya recently. 

### Traders, Guns & Money, Satyajit Das
*May 2022*  
Never really knew what derivatives were. Marginally better appreciation now. Think this might have been a fairly cynical take on the world. Amusing nonetheless.

### The boy who shot down and airship, Michael Green
*June 2022*  
The freedom of growing up pre-'technology' and under the shadow of war.

### Seabiscuit, Laura Hillenbrand
*June 2022*  
Depression-era race horse. Though light on details the training regime of these horses is interesting. 

### Double Agent, Tom Brady 
*July 2022*  
Turns out this was a sequel... still, a good read and will forever be the book I read at the track before running sub-4.

### , 
*July 2022*  
A series of short essays about China. The most interesting, for me, were around the Beijing 2008 Olympics and the perception of the games.
