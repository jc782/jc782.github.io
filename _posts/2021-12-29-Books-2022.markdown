## Summary:
So begins another year, once again 2 books / month is the target. I'd like, again, to read a few more classics and also more history. 

## Reading list:
* The design of everyday things
* No surrender


### Good Data, Sam Gilbert
*Jan 2021*  
An optimist's guide to our digital future. A reasonable take on the legitimacy of big-tech and the value of data. Most interesting sections around the development of 'Bought by Many' and how they looked into this.
