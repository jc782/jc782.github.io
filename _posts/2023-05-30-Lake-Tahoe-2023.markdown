description: Memorial Day weekend at Lake Tahoe

A conference either side of memorial day made a nice sandwich to fit a weekend in the mountains in California in. After flying in from LA on Friday morning I made my way, along with throngs of others, toward Lake Tahoe on Friday evening. The drive was long, but especially the last hour through the mountains was pretty. Over the Donner pass the volume of snow at the resorts was astonishing given it was nearly June. 

At dusk I arrived to Tahoe City. More a village than a city. Strictly a 'linear settlement'. It is squeezed between Lake Tahoe and the Sierra mountains behind.

On Saturday I had intended to hire a bike but the road biking on the lake front was busy and the roads potholed and narrow. I was advised against riding a lap of the lake. Mountain biking, usually a great option in the summer, was not yet open due to flooding from snowmelt. With this it seemed like skiing might be a better option and so I headed up to Palisades (previously Squaw Valley) to check it out. Unsurprisingly the snow was soft (it was warm) but plentiful (they had an insane winter). From Palisades I ran a 10miler on the Truckee river trail. Gentle inclines were a timely reminder that Tahoe is up at ~6200ft altitude.

Sunday I rose early, and sucked up the $$ for a lift ticket at Palisades. Open from 8am till 2pm I was on the first lift and cruising groomers for the first hour. The snow was sticky in places, it hadn't refrozen. I developed a new technique of 'pushing' the snow around rather usual holding an edge. As the day warmed and the snow softened the skiing on steeper terrain was most enjoyable. Squaw is spoilt for quality terrain. KT-22, of GNAR fame, and the competition moguls set were particularly good.

In the afternoon there was plenty of time to get in a long run. Chris Olley and I ran along Billionaire Row and then the full East Shore Trail. It was a delightfully rolling path with beautiful views. 

Monday was another travel day, but before this I made it out for a run on the Tahoe rim trail (TRT) until its path was lost over a snow field. New North Face trail shoes were on point. A final activity before heading back to the Bay was making it out onto the lake on a SUP to get that alternative perspective.

Lastly, the conclusive proof that everything is bigger in the US. Giant pinecones!
