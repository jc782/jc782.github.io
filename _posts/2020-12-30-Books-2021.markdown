## Summary:

As per 2020 I am aiming for 2 books per month, with the additional target of 30 books in the year. Books on the To-Read pile are also listed.

## To Read:
No Surrender (Hiroo Onoda)  
The Great Influenza (pandemics, yeah!)  
Guns, Germs, and Steel  
Skunkworks
The Making of the fittest
The big moo

### Red Notice, Bill Browder
*Jan 2021*  
Gripping book which starts with tales of making boatloads of money in Russia and with legistalation for human rights. The corruption remaining in Russia is mildly terrifying.

### Catch-22, Joseph Heller
*Jan 2021*  
Enjoyable fiction with suitable satire throughout. Truly understanding what a catch-22 is enlightening.

### The Big Moo, Seth Godin
*Feb 2021*  
Bitesize advice - easy to read and probably some truths.

### Are Prisons Obsolete?, Angela Davis
*Feb 2021*  
Interesting book - very essay like. Title should probably be 'Prisons Are Obsolete'. Will be interesting to see the evolution over the next decades.

### The making of the fittest, Sean B. Carrol
*Feb 2021*  
Good technical details - the repetition of natural selection is fascinating (ie antifreeze fish in Arctic / antarctic) - it's interesting to think about current selection pressures (anthropological ones)
