## Summary:

As per 2020 I am aiming for 2 books per month, with the additional target of 30 books in the year.

## To Read:
No Surrender (Hiroo Onoda)  
The Great Influenza (pandemics, yeah!)  
Guns, Germs, and Steel  


### Red Notice, Bill Browder
*Jan 2021*  
Gripping book which starts with tales of making boatloads of money in Russia and with legistalation for human rights. The amount of corruption in Russia is mildly terrifying.

### Catch-22, Joseph Heller
*Jan 2021*  
Enjoyable fiction with suitable satire throughout. Now I truly understand what a catch-22 is.

### The Big Moo, Seth Godin
*Feb 2021*  
Bitesize advice - easy to read and probably some truths.

### Are Prisons Obsolete?, Angela Davis
*Feb 2021*  
Interesting book (essay). Title should probably be 'Prisons Are Obsolete'. Not sure if UK situation is akin to America.

### The making of the fittest, Sean B. Carrol
*Feb 2021*  
Good technical details - the repetition of natural selection is fascinating (ie antifreeze fish in Arctic / antarctic) - it's interesting to think about current selection pressures (anthropological ones)

### The Paper Menagerie, Ken Lui
*Feb 2021*  
Alarming to read first hand account about the CCP making people 'disappear', and people so desperate to leave they will sell themselves. Tragic that the author could not reconcile with his mother while she was alive. 

### Skunkworks, Ben Rich (et al)
*Mar 2021*  
Been on the list for a while, and was an excellent read. Incredibly achievements with a relatively small and lean team. Makes you wonder how much more we could be doing now with the right investment. Also RS-71 -> SR-71 is an amusing mistake.
