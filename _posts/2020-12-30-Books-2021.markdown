## Summary:

As per 2020 I am aiming for 2 books per month, with the additional target of 30 books in the year.

## To Read:
No Surrender (Hiroo Onoda)  
The Great Influenza (pandemics, yeah!)  


### Red Notice, Bill Browder
*Jan 2021*  
Gripping book which starts with tales of making boatloads of money in Russia and with legistalation for human rights. The amount of corruption in Russia is mildly terrifying.

### Catch-22, Joseph Heller
*Jan 2021*  
Enjoyable fiction with suitable satire throughout. Now I truly understand what a catch-22 is.

### The Big Moo, Seth Godin
*Feb 2021*  
Bitesize advice - easy to read and probably some truths.

### Are Prisons Obsolete?, Angela Davis
*Feb 2021*  
Interesting book (essay). Title should probably be 'Prisons Are Obsolete'. Not sure if UK situation is akin to America.

### The making of the fittest, Sean B. Carrol
*Feb 2021*  
Good technical details - the repetition of natural selection is fascinating (ie antifreeze fish in Arctic / antarctic) - it's interesting to think about current selection pressures (anthropological ones)

### The Paper Menagerie, Ken Lui
*Feb 2021*  
Alarming to read first hand account about the CCP making people 'disappear', and people so desperate to leave they will sell themselves. Tragic that the author could not reconcile with his mother while she was alive. 

### Skunkworks, Ben Rich (et al)
*Mar 2021*  
Been on the list for a while, and was an excellent read. Incredibly achievements with a relatively small and lean team. Makes you wonder how much more we could be doing now with the right investment. Also RS-71 -> SR-71 is an amusing mistake.

### Jakob's Colours, Lindsay Hawdon
*Mar 2021*  
A clever novel in which a Roma boy tries to survive WW2. Flashbacks to the lives of his parents provide insight into Gypsy hardships. Unsurprisingly colourful descriptions, but not a pageturner.

### Lion, Saroo Brierley
*Apr 2021*  
A child gets lost in India, survives the streets of Calcutta, gets adopted, then uses Google Earth to find his home. I watched the film, and the book matched up well. Astonishing number of memories from before the age of 5.

### Deep Thinking, Garry Kasparov
*Apr 2021*  
Mostly musings by Kasparov on the development of Chess engines. I liked the comment that things are intelligent until we learn how to make a machine do it, and then, in the world of 1s and 0s, we deem them no longer intelligent. Following reading this I played Stockfish on its highest level and got destroyed in 12moves...

### The Coldest March, Susan Solomon
*May 2021*  
Really enjoyed this account of Captain Scott's journey to the Pole. Especially impressed by the winter sledge trip made by Bowers, Wilson, and Cherry-Garrard. To me it seems likely that Bowers and Wilson could perhaps have survived. Truly unimaginable conditions though. Mind blown when I realised the title refers to the month.

### Russians Among Us, Gordon Corera
*May 2021*  
Russia's approach to the West is fascinating - the lengths they can go to to infiltrate society to gain mostly benign information is amazing. TO what end is this worthwhile. One wonders what is happening nowadays. A nice complement to Red Notice.

### The Word is Murder, Anthony Horowitz
*June 2021*  
Meta murder mystery - parts were good but I struggled to get my head around the 1st person references to him writing the book. Part 1 of 3. tbc whether I'll read the others.

### Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond
*June 2021*  
Been inching through this - it was more academic than expected. The book aims to explain western dominance in the last 500yrs. The shift from hunter/gatherer to farming in the fertile crescent, and the domestication of animals is interesting. The early differences becoming magnified over time. Similar in ways to Prisoners of Geography but at a more fundamental level than political level.

### The Gene Hunters, William Cookson
*June 2021*  
In a parallel universe I may have been a geneticist. Very interesting read.

### Wintergirls, Laurie Halse Anderson
*July 2021*  
Wanted to learn a bit more about EDs. Fiction seemed a decent option.

### The Sentence Is Death, Anthony Horowitz
*July 2021*  
Second installment in this series; enjoyed this one more than the first. Leaves you wondering what is true/real and what is fiction. Will probably read the third when it comes out.
