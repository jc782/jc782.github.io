### Red Notice, Bill Browder
*Jan 2021*  
Gripping book which starts with tales of making boatloads of money in Russia and with legistalation for human rights. The corruption remaining in Russia is mildly terrifying.

### Catch-22, Joseph Heller
*Jan 2021*  
Enjoyable fiction with suitable satire throughout. Truly understanding what a catch-22 is enlightening.
